die_chart.py is where the app is run.  
-Die() = accepts the number of sides of the die you want to use, if left empty, it equals 6
-Add as many Die objects into die_list
-Change the integer in .record_rolls(die_list, 10000) function, to change the number of rolls

***The program will create a histogram of the count of numbers rolled. The title, x-axis, and the length of histogram will change accordingly to any changes made to: amount of rolls, amount of die, and the number of sides on a die***

The histogram will be saved on the repository 'die_visual.svg'
